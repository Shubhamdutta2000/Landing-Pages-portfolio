            So the bar is where I go
            Me and my friends at the table doing shots
            Drinking fast and then we talk slow
            Come over and start up a conversation with just me
            And trust me I'll give it a chance now
            Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
            And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
            Girl, you know I want your love
            Your love was handmade for somebody like me
            Come on now, follow my lead
            I may be crazy, don't mind me
            Say, boy, let's not talk too much
            Grab on my waist and put that body on me
            Come on now, follow my lead
            Come, come on now, follow my lead
            I'm in love with the shape of you
            We push and pull like a magnet do
            Although my heart is falling too
            Every day discovering something brand new
            I'm in love with your body
            Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
